# components-from-the-web

Random components I saw on the web and wanted to recreate in Svelte. Pure Svelte 5 + Tailwind + Lucide icons,
no UI library. More info in each route's README.

SvelteKit app bootstrapped with [create-wih-app](https://github.com/WarningImHack3r/create-wih-app).

## Run the app

```sh
bun dev
```
